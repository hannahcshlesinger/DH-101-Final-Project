# DH 101: Practicing The Digital Humanities
A repository for my final group project for Digital Humanities 101: Practicing Digital Humanities taught by Dr Brooks Jessup at UC Berkeley as a part of the Digital Humanities Summer Minor, 2021

## Group Project Abstract
Behind every computer is a human creator with their own biases and particular world view. Our group project, “Bias and Exclusivity in the Digital Humanities” explores the context and consequences of separating the human elements from the technologies we use. We presented based on the following articles: Why Are Digital Humanitie So White? Or Thinking the Histories of Race and Computation” by Tara McPherson, “Making a Case for the Black Digital Humanities” by Kim Gallon, “All the Digital Humanities are White, All Nerds Are Men, But Some of Us Are Brave” by Moya Z. Bailey and “Maps, Mapmaking, and Critical Pedagogy: Exploring GIS and Maps as a Teaching Tool for Social Change” by Denise Pacheco and Veronica Velez. These authors draw attention to how ignoring or disregarding the fundamental ways we talk about the humanities are rooted in racist and flawed powered systems. The authors call for a reimagining of the field that incorporates race theory, feminist theory, and cultural context at the core of how we use and talk about our technologies. I specifically focused on placing computing systems like UNIX in their political, historical contexts to understand how computing sytems and their design philopsophies mirror or reflect contemporary ideologies. Emily discussed the importance of Black digital humanities, emphasizing the imporance of recovering lost historical and literary texts. Graham concluded our presentation by discussing the biases that map makers have when creating maps, specifically with regard to geographic information system (GIS) and how misuse and misrepresentation of data can harm marginalized communities. Each member in our group was crucial in unpacking and interpreting the arguments or the articles in our project. Ultimately our presentation aimed to argue that technology and tools should not be viewed as neutral tools and that trying to separate the human from the digital continues to perpetuate existing systems of structural inequality.
