# DH 101: Practicing The Digital Humanities
A repository for my final group project for Digital Humanities 101: Practicing Digital Humanities taught by Dr Brooks Jessup at UC Berkeley as a part of the Digital Humanities Summer Minor, 2021

## Group Project Abstract
Behind every computer is a human maker and every human being has their own biases and world view. Our group project, “Bias and Exclusivity in the Digital Humanities” explores the context and consequences of separating the human elements from the technologies we use. We presented based on the following articles: Why Are Digital Humanitie So White? Or Thinking the Histories of Race and Computation” by Tara McPherson, “Making a Case for the Black Digital Humanities” by Kim Gallon, “All the Digital Humanities are White, All Nerds Are Men, But Some of Us Are Brave” by Moya Z. Bailey and “Maps, Mapmaking, and Critical Pedagogy: Exploring GIS and Maps as a Teaching Tool for Social Change” by Denise Pacheco and Veronica Velez. These authors draw attention to how ignoring or disregarding the fundamental ways we talk about the humanities are rooted in racist and flawed powered systems. The authors call for a reimagining of the field that incorporates race theory, feminist theory, and cultural context at the core of how we use and talk about our technologies. Each member in our group was crucial in unpacking and interpreting the arguments or the articles in our project. Emily comes from an engineering background whereas Graham has a media studies background and I’m an English major. I think uniting our different disciplines and worldviews ultimately benefited our project.
